# Cycle 3 Deliverables

Structured as per Cycle 2 example structure. Code inspections were all done formally on GitHub using pull requests. Each one of us checked out a pull request, commented as needed,
discussed if needed, and approved or denied as needed. Snapshots of our code at different times will also be provided within that folder. Everything else should be pretty
straightforward.
