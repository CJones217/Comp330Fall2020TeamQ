# Cycle 1 Deliverables
INSTRUCTIONS: FamilyTreeInputTextFile.txt must be placed in the ROOT directory.
In intelliJ this can sometimes be a level lower then expected! When in doubt put
a copy anywhere!

This seems to be a per machine issue. For the majority of our testing, placing the text file in the projects root directory works.
If the root does not work, put the file one level above the root as this has worked in the past.
Please reach out to us if the problem continues.

Compile and run FamilyGraph (under src)
to recieve an ouput showing that parsing and writing to 
an internal graph structure was succesfull. 

For EXPECTE OUTPUT see ExampleOutput.pdf
