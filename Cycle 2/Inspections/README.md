# Code Inspections

Instead of writing a formal report or something, we decided to just use GitHub's branching and pull requests features to do code inspections. Any bad pushes were rejected
and any good ones were approved and merged by a member of the team. These are previous commits, so you can see the development of the code throughout Cycle 2 development.
